Reshade Presets for the game "MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD". Mostly used for screenshots.

<h1>Raeji's Urban</h2>

A filter that adds a cold, dramatic touch. Slightly desaturates photos to complement the cool tone.

<h1>Raeji's Boho + HDR</h2>

A filter that gives off a warm vibe. Perfect for indoor. Glow can make highlights pop out.

<h1>Raeji's Vivid</h2>

A filter that pops the colors, as well as the skin. When used in the perfect scene, images can look great. Very circumstantial.

Probably my best filter so far. Emphasizes the colors and details. RTGI is recommended for added realism. Great with DOF.

<h2>Installation<h2>
Drag all .ini files into your Presets folder.
Create a separate folder for my shaders and add a texture+effect search path to that folder. (Or merge it, up to you!)

Use CinematicDOF by Otis_Inf. Tweak it so that the background is verrrry blurred if you want a portrait shot. Use an upscaler if you find your resolution too low.
Max your video settings for a good pic. You can always turn it down later. Turn off MH's Anti-aliasing.
